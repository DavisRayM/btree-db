# BTree DB

This repository contains a database implementation built on the B+-Tree datastructure.

## TODO List

- [ ] Implement the B+-Tree structure
    - [x] Ability to add a record
    - [x] Ability to read records from leaf nodes
    - [ ] Implement the traversal functionality
    - [ ] Implement the split functionality
    - [ ] Implement overflow pages functionality; *Tentative: I might just remove the concept of overflow pages from this*
    - [ ] Ability to read data present in the entire tree
- [ ] Turn it into a distributed database server
    - [ ] Figure out how to do this
